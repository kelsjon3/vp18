# 🔧 Civitai Integration Debug Guide

## ✅ **Good News - It's Working!**

Your logs show the Civitai integration is **successfully connecting**:
```
DEBUG: Fetching Civitai models with API key: 3cecd0a35b...
DEBUG: Civitai API error: 400 -
```

This means:
- ✅ **API Key Found**: Your API key is stored and being used
- ✅ **Network Working**: App successfully reaches Civitai servers  
- ✅ **Request Sent**: HTTP request is being made correctly
- ❌ **400 Error**: Bad Request - parameter issue (now fixed!)

## 🔄 **Latest Fix Applied**

**Updated APK Location**: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Simplified API Parameters**: Removed problematic sort/period parameters causing 400 error
2. **Multiple Auth Methods**: Tries both header auth and query parameter auth  
3. **Better Error Logging**: More detailed error messages
4. **Fallback Strategy**: If auth fails, tries without API key first

## 📱 **Test the Updated APK**

### Install & Test:
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Debug Steps:
1. **Add Civitai Source**: Settings → Civitai → Enter API key
2. **Cycle to Civitai**: Player → Tap sync button → Look for "Civitai" in top-right
3. **Check Logs**: `adb logcat | grep "DEBUG:"`

### Expected Log Output:
```
DEBUG: Fetching Civitai models with API key: 3cecd0a35b...
DEBUG: Successfully fetched 20 models from Civitai
```

OR (if still having issues):
```
DEBUG: Civitai API error: 400 - Bad Request
DEBUG: Response body: [detailed error message]
DEBUG: Retrying with API key as query parameter...
DEBUG: Successfully fetched 20 models with API key
```

## 🛠️ **If Still Not Working**

### Verify API Key:
1. Go to [civitai.com/user/account](https://civitai.com/user/account)
2. Check if API key is valid
3. Generate new API key if needed
4. Re-add in app settings

### Check Internet:
- Ensure device has internet connection
- Try browsing to civitai.com in device browser

### Alternative Test:
- Try without API key first (many models are public)
- Add Civitai source but leave API key blank
- Should still load some public models

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

When working correctly:
1. **Add Civitai Source** → "Civitai" appears in Settings source list
2. **Navigate to Player** → Tap sync button to cycle sources  
3. **Civitai Active** → "Civitai" shows in top-right corner
4. **Content Loads** → Real AI-generated images from Civitai
5. **Swipe Navigation** → Smooth vertical scrolling through models

## 🔍 **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Watch debug logs
adb logcat | grep "DEBUG:"

# Watch all app logs  
adb logcat | grep "com.vp18.mediaplayer"

# Check network connectivity
adb shell ping civitai.com
```
