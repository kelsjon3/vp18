# 🔧 Android Emulator Troubleshooting

## ✅ Good News: Your APK is Fine!

The Gradle warnings you see are **NOT** causing emulator issues:
```
[Incubating] Problems report is available at: file:///home/kelsjon3/projects/vp18/build/reports/problems/problems-report.html
Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.
```

These are just **deprecation warnings** - they don't affect APK functionality or emulator launching.

## 🔍 Emulator Status Check

✅ **Android SDK Found**: `/home/kelsjon3/Android/Sdk/emulator/`
